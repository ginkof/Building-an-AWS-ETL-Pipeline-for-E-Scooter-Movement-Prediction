# Building an AWS ETL Pipeline for E-Scooter Movement Prediction

Utilized Python and SQL for building an AWS ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for predicting e-scooter movements for Gans, a leading e-scooter-sharing startup. Leveraging web scraping, API integration, and database management, we collect and transform data from various sources. By deploying the pipeline on AWS cloud infrastructure, we ensure scalability and automation. Valuable insights and learnings are shared in a concise [Medium article](https://medium.com/@gian.inkof/data-pipelines-on-the-cloud-or-what-it-actually-means-to-extract-transform-and-load-etl-data-1ad23cd2bb6).
